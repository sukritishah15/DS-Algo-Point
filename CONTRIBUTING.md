### Note:

- Issues will be assigned on a **_first come, first serve_ basis**. The person who creates the issue gets the first priority. And then, issues are assigned based on who commented first. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned and the **programming language** you are going to use, and it will be done if found fit.
- You cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you.
- If you have anything else in mind, FEEL FREE TO CREATE AN ISSUE and please wait for it to be assigned to you. If assigned to you, then you can start working on it and create a PR.
- **All PRs must be made from a Branch. Create a separate branch for every Issue you are working upon and then create a PR.**
- **In your code file, add (Inside a multiline comment) Sample Input and Output at the end of the file along with Time and Space Complexity.**
- Every time you add a file via a Pull Request also update the README.md file for that particular language in **Alphabetical Order** in the same PR. Make sure you don't change the `Readme.md` in root of project but the `Readme.md` in folder of language you're working.
- **Plagiarism is not encouraged and a plagiarized PR won't be accepted at all.**
- **PR should be created within a week of you being assigned to it.**
- **At no point of time, you can claim more than 4 issues i.e. you can have at max 4 working issues, for this repository, at any point of time.**
