## Overview

- The goal of this project is to have codes for various data structures and algorithms - in C, C++, Java and Python. 
- Feel free to contribute in any way you want.
- Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines listed below.

## Content

- We currently have 4 folders for 4 programming languages - C, C++, Java, Python.
- **Do not create folders in your submissions, unless specifically told to do so.**

## Contribution Guidelines

- Issues will be assigned on a **_first come, first serve_ basis**. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned and the **programming language** you should be assigned in, and it will be done if found fit.
- You cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you.
- If you have anything else in mind, create an issue and please wait for it to be assigned to you. You can then start working on it and create a PR.
- **All PRs must be made from a Branch. Create a separate branch for every Issue you are working upon and then create a PR.**
- **In your code file, add (Inside Comment) Sample Input and Output at the end of the file along with Time and Space Complexity.**
- Every time you add a file via a Pull Request also update the README.md file for that particular language in **Alphabetical Order** in the same PR. You'll find a README.md file in each language folder.
- **Plagiarism is not encouraged and a plagiarized PR won't be accepted at all.**
- **PR should be created within a week of you being assigned to it.**
- **At no point of time, you can claim more than 4 issues i.e. you can have at max 4 working issues, for this repository, at any point of time.**

### Where to upload the files

**PLEASE READ THIS**

- Your files should be uploaded directly into the corresponding folder (e.g. if you wrote code for a Data Structure in C-Plus-Plus, it goes inside the C-Plus-Plus folder and so on)
- Edit the corresponding _README.md_ file to **add the link to your code in the corresponding section** ([GitHub Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- **Under no circumstances create new folders within the language folders to upload your code unless specifically told to do so**.
