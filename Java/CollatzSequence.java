/**
 * The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows:
 * start with any positive integer n.
 * Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows:
 * if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term.
 * If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
 * The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
