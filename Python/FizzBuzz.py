Function print_fizz_buzz:

Input: 2 integers, start point and end point

Output: prints the words Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz or integer itself 
for each number between start and end point (inclusive) 

Time complexity: O(N) (N is length of range of numbers)

Space complexity: O(1) (Uses only constant memory for iterator from start to end)

Sample Input/Output:

Input: start_point=1, end_point=5
print_fizz_buzz(1, 5)

Output:
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
