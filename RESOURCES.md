Hacktoberfest® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer or a student learning to code.

* Hacktoberfest is a celebration open to everyone in our global community.
* Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
* You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

### Visit [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) Website to know more.

### How to register:

* Go to <https://github.com> & create an account.
* Then register at <https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/register> by logging through your GitHub Account and you're all set to contribute for Hacktoberfest.

### But there are some rules for Hacktoberfest and here we go:
To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31, 2020 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 70,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.

Read the [participation details](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details) to learn how to earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward.
