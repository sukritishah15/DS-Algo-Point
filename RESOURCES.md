# Hacktoberfest-2020

HacktoberfestÂ® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether youâ€™re a developer or a student learning to code.

* Hacktoberfest is a celebration open to everyone in our global community.
* Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
* You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

### Visit [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) Website to know more.

### How to register:

* Go to <https://github.com> & create an account.
* Then register at <https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/register> by logging through your GitHub Account and you're all set to contribute for Hacktoberfest.

### But there are some rules for Hacktoberfest and here we go:
To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31, 2020 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the projectâ€™s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 70,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.

Read the [participation details](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details) to learn how to earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward.
